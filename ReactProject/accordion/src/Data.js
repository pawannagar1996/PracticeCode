        answer : "The Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework is an architectural/design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components Model, View, and Controller.

        question : "Explain the building blocks of React?",
        answer : `Components: These are reusable blocks of code that return HTML.
        JSX: It stands for JavaScript and XML and allows you to write HTML in React.
        Props and State: props are like function parameters and State is similar to variables.
        Context: This allows data to be passed through components as props in a hierarchy.
        Virtual DOM: It is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM which makes DOM manipulation easier.`
